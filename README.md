# Integrated-Circuit-Tester
This contains the VHDL codes used to create an Integrated circuit Tester in VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) for my final year project in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. 
The code can be adapted to test any chip by changing the values in the "Define-Values-Package". The example test in the code is for testing a 4 input AND-gate. A short video demonstrating it in operation is available on youtube:https://youtu.be/smiZztOeFQ4
